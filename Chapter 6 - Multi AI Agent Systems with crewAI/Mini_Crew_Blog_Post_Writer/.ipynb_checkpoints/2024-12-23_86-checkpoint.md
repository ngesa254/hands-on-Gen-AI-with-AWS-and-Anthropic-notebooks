# AI21's Jamba Model Family: A Breakthrough in Language AI

AI21 has made groundbreaking advancements with their novel SSM-Transformer architecture, culminating in the release of their Jamba model family. The key highlights are:

1. **Jamba**: The world's first production-grade model built on the Mamba Structured State Space (SSM) technology combined with elements of the traditional Transformer architecture. This hybrid approach compensates for the limitations of a pure SSM model.

2. **Unprecedented Context Window**: Jamba offers an industry-leading context window of 256,000 tokens, enabling it to handle and process extremely long sequences of data with superior performance and quality compared to traditional Transformer models.

3. **Jamba-Instruct**: An aligned version of Jamba, specifically designed for instructional tasks, is now available in public preview on the AI21 Platform, allowing commercial use of this cutting-edge technology.

4. **Jamba 1.5 Family**: AI21 has released two new open-source models in the Jamba family - Jamba 1.5 Mini and Jamba 1.5 Large. These models leverage the novel SSM-Transformer architecture to deliver superior long context handling, speed, and quality, outperforming competitors in their respective size classes.

5. **Non-Transformer Breakthrough**: The Jamba 1.5 models mark the first time a non-Transformer model has successfully been scaled to match the quality and strength of the market's leading Transformer models, a significant milestone in the field of AI.

6. **Efficiency and Performance**: By combining the strengths of SSMs and Transformers, the Jamba models achieve improved latency and efficiency compared to pure Transformer models like Llama 8B and 70B, while handling longer data sequences more effectively.

AI21's advancements with the SSM-Transformer architecture and the Jamba model family represent a paradigm shift in the field of AI, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with language models and setting new standards for context handling, performance, and quality.
