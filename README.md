# Hands on Gen AI with AWS and Anthropic Book by Ngesa Marvin, First Edition

## Companion Jupyter notebooks for the book

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book [# Hands on Gen AI with AWS and Anthropic by Ngesa Marvin, First Edition](https://www.linkedin.com/in/engngesamarvin/).

For readability, these notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles, and omit everything else in the book: text paragraphs, figures, and pseudocode.
**If you want to be able to follow what's going on, I recommend reading the notebooks side by side with your copy of the book.**
