      "Answer: Endpoint Security – COBO (Corporate Owned, Business Only) and COPE (Corporate Owned Personally Enabled) are two endpoint security strategies used by organizations to manage and secure devices in their network. COBO refers to devices that are owned, managed, and used exclusively for business purposes. COPE, on the other hand, refers to devices that are owned by employees but are used for both personal and business purposes. Both strategies aim to ensure data privacy and security while enabling productivity and flexibility.
